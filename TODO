TODO List for Journal

*) Have separate bands for each data type in the diary view (not so useful
in the lifeline view).
Hmm, that won't really work, because a "highlight" band can only sync
with a single band -- the you wouldn't get the neat "summary" view.  Ahh,
but you could have multiple highlight bands, one per data type band.
 - In the lifeline, you could have multiple bands based on tags.  A
 "relationships" band, a "housing" band, "jobs", "concerts", etc.  Any
 event/period whose tag doesn't correspond to a user-defined band is
 rendered in the "other/misc" band.  Lets people segment however they
 want.

*) A narrow band at the top that somehow has an on-click to bring up an
"add an entry/event/period/whatever" dialog.

*) Add per-decade clicky bits on the lifeline page, and per-month and
next/prev year on diary.  

*) BikeRide mileage should be a float.  Duration should either take time
in HH:MM, or just be removed.

*) Better rendering of event detail.

We fetch bubble detail via AJAX, should we then cache it?  If so, how to
invalidate cache?

*) Get rid of 'duration' attr on Activity.
