TODO List for Journal

*) Have separate bands for each data type in both lifeline and diary views.

*) A narrow band at the top that somehow has an on-click to bring up an
"add an entry/event/period/whatever" dialog.

*) Add per-decade clicky bits on the lifeline page, and per-month and
next/prev year on diary.
