This commit brings the app to the bare minimum for usability.

	* diary/models.py (Entry): Add date field, and order by it.  Add
	relation to Consumables.
	(Consumable): New model for yummy stuff.
	(DiningOut): Add where field and relation to Consumables.
    (*): Proper use of blank and null attrs in model fields.	
 
	* diary/admin.py (EntryAdmin): Use date instead of created, add
	inline for Consumables.
	(*Inline): Comment out fields attr, to see if that makes working in the
	Django admin easier.
	
	* apache/app.wsgi: Entry point for mod_wsgi.
	
 	* settings.py: Use DEVELOPMENT environment variable to control various
	settings.
